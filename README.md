# Fully_Functional_Web_Application_For_Computer_Shop

This Infact solution online computer store system is an endeavor to overcome the present 
inefficient and time-consuming process of locating and purchasing quality computer part in the 
store 
The main point of this project was to cover the Infact Solution system as they had no automated 
system beforehand. So, our objective was to come up with a computerized framework which 
would cover up with a advanced framework which would nearly cover up almost all of the 
functions. Therefore, we have used MERN technology to implement all our functions in the 
system. Through our automated computer store system, we provide an easy way of searching, 
reserving, and purchasing of products.
We have covered the following eight functions in this proposed system.
• Product Inventory Management
• User Account Management
• Admin Account Management
• General Information Management
• Delivery and Distribution Management
• Product Overview and Feedback Section Management
• Product Purchase Process Management
• Advertising and Marketing Management
Above functions were handled by the eight group members during the time period of three 
months and managed to drag through and an ethical framework was made with all the 
functioning properties. There were numerous resources used in this process and lot of hard work 
was involved. At last, we came up with the system that all the client requirements are satisfied. 
Moreover, the shop gets the advantage as they can carry out the sales and other functions instead 
of working physically.
Customer and client fulfillment play the foremost crucial part in any form of product and service. 
Therefore, we have implemented the system to facilitate both customer and client satisfaction up 
to a great extent. Since the technical facilities are expanding in great heaps, proposed system will 
encourage improving efficiency immensely
